The Holiday tables involved are defined on the company record, in the OFFICIAL.HOLIDAY and BRANCH.HOLIDAY fields. If both the official and branch holiday tables have the same day defined as a working day then the CURRENT.DAY will be set as NORMAL, if the official holiday table defines a day as a holiday and the branch holiday defines it as working then the CURRENT.DAY will be defined as RESTRICTED and if both tables define the day as a holiday then the CURRENT.DAY value will be defined as closed.

This allows a small number of branch holiday tables to be defined with holidays particular to a branch defined on the compant recoed for the branch.
It is possible at VERSION level in the BUSINESS.DAY field to determine whether the version can be run based on the type of business day, so that a limited number of business activities can be permitted on a restricted working day.

Validation rules
Noinput field



This field indicates the type of business day and indicates differences between the official holiday table and the branch holiday table as defined on the COMPANY record.
NORMAL  the branch (company) is open on an official working day
RESTRICTED  the branch is open on an official holiday, e.g. a weekend or public holiday
CLOSED  the branch is closed i.e. the holiday table for the branch indicates a non working day, or the day corresponds to a value on the BRNACH.CLOSED field for the company
It is possible to determine whether a VERSION can be run based on the value of the CURRENT.DAY, so that business activities can be restricted when a branch is open on an official holiday.
If the BRANCH.HOLIDAY is different to the OFFICIAL.HOLIDAY then the LOCAL.COUNTRY will be blank and the BRANCH.HOLIDAY will be used to populate the LOCAL.REGION field.
If they are the same then the first two characters of the OFFICIAL.HOLIDAY field will be used to populate the LOCAL.COUNTRY field and the LOCAL.REGION.FIELD will be blank.
