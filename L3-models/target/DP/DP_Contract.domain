/* SY.ACCU.DECU is the transaction processing application used for booking accumulator/decumulator contracts.

Accumulators are structured products that allow investors to purchase shares at a pre-determined strike price, which is at a discount to the current stock price. An investor purchases (accumulates), a fixed quantity of an underlying share at the strike price, on each trading day of the investment period.

Decumulators on the other hand, are structured products that allow investors to sell a fixed quantity of an underlying share at a pre-determined strike price, on each trading day of the investment period. This forward price is set at a premium to the initial spot price of the underlying share.

Accumulators and Decumulators are structured with a knock-out feature. This means that they can be early terminated when the price of the underlying share closes at above/below a pre-determined barrier price (also known as knock-out price which is set below the initial spot price).
When the price of the underlying share closes at above or below the pre-determined barrier price, a knock-out event is deemed to have occurred. The shares are accrued on a daily basis. Settlement of aggregate units occurs regularly on pre-determined settlement dates.

Apart from being the input application for recording accumulator/decumulator contracts, the SY.ACCU.DECU application also tracks the lifecycle of the contract from inception to its termination.
Termination of the contract could occur  when the contractually agreed maturity date is reached or through various exit triggers such as 'Knock Out' or 'Unwind'. The exit triggers for the contract is also updated within the SY.ACCU.DECU application. */
