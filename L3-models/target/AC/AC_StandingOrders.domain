/* Encompassed within the Funds Transfer Module is a fully operational Bulk Standing Orders application. In many respects it is similar to the Standing Order application, except of course it allows outgoing payments to be bulked together for different creditors from one account, i.e. one debit, lots of credits.
This will allow the user to load standing orders as Fixed Payments with a known amount. It is possible either to execute one-off payments or with an associated frequency (e.g. the monthly payment of staff salaries).
The application may be run on-line or as an end-of-day process.  In order to run the Bulk Standing Orders on-line, there is a separate application called SINGLE.BULK.STO. For more details refer to the relevant help text.
The BULK.STO file has the standard 3 versions:
.'Live' file            .'Unauthorised' file            .'History' file.

If the Id is given with a a date, then it will be consider as a Single Payment Type of Bulk STO and the id date will be defaulted to single payment date. ID date has to be greater than today.
For a frequency based Bulk Standing order, the id has to be created with account no followed by automatically generated sequence number.
Hence for a same date using the sequence no, more than one Bulk Standing Orders can be created.

During the creation of a new Bulk Standing Order the Account must be input     as the System will always generate the next sequential Bulk Standing number.
If Date is entered as a part of ID, Id date defaulted as the Single     payment date and ID date has to be greater than today.

/* Encompassed within the Funds Transfer Module is a fully operational Standing Order Application.  This Application provides the following facilities:
1.        Funds Management Initiated By Balance Levels
The User can determine, on any account, Funds            Management conditions by specifying balance levels which            can operate in two ways:  As an indicator identifying a            balance level starting from which funds must be            transferred either into, or out of, the Account
2.        Fixed and Preset Payments
This will allow the User to load Standing Orders as Fixed            payments with known amount and frequency (e.g. the            monthly payment of the rent) or as preset payments            where the amount is unknown (e.g. payment of gas bill).
3.        Diary Instructions
Any account Diary instructions can be defined with their            related frequency.  An on-line retrieval facility            (Sto.Diary) will then allow the User to check at any time            the outstanding Diary instructions.
4.        Direct Debits
This facility will allow the User to load the Direct Debit            mandates which the bank has received from the Customer            and which authorises the bank to accept Direct Debits            received on the Account.  When the Direct Debits are            actually received by the bank, the User will then access            this file to check if the appropriate mandate has been            received from the Customer.
5.        Maturing Deposits
This facility will allow the User to pay away the balance            on an account to the beneficiary details set up on the            standing order on a particular date specified on the record.            The facility can be used to mature a fixed term deposit account.
6.        Periodic Payment of Interest
This facility will allow the User to pay away any interest            capitalised on an account periodically to the beneficiary            details specified on the record.

If required, up to 999 different Standing Order            instructions can be created on any account.
During the End Of Day processing, the Application will            access the internal file (Standing.Order.Fqu) to process            all Standing Orders due for each day since the last run            date up to and including todays date.  Two separate end            of day processes are run, STO.BALANCES is run at end            of day to process Balance Maintenance Standing Orders,            STO.PAYMENTS is run at start of day to process all            other Standing Orders.  The following steps will then be            taken by the Application:
(i)        A Funds Transfer transaction will be generated for all            Standing Orders due since the last run date and these            transactions will be automatically Authorised provided no            error conditions or overrides exist.
(ii)       Where error conditions or overrides exist (e.g. there are            insufficient funds on the Standing Order account to            execute the instruction), the Funds Transfer Transaction            will be put on a Held status (code IHLD) and this            transaction will be listed on the Exception Display of the            Funds Transfer Application.  The next day, the User can            then access these transactions, make the necessary            corrections and/or determine the action to be taken on            overrides.  These transactions will then follow the normal            validation and authorisation process of the Funds            Transfer Application.
(iii)      When the Application is processing BI Balance            Maintenance Standing Orders and funds are not available            to pay into the Account, an unauthorised Funds Transfer            transaction will be generated with a status of IHLD.  The            override field will specify the Amount Required, the            Amount available and, if applicable, the Minimum balance            to be kept in the Account from which the funds have to be            taken.  With the help of this information, the User will            then decide on what action to take.
(iv)       Any transaction generated by the Standing Order            Application can be identified from the content of the            internal field Inward Payment Type which will contain the            value of STO and the Standing Order sequential number.
Relationship Between Files Within The Application The flow chart which follows shows the relationships between the various files existing in the Standing Order Application.  For details of Funds Transfer files (prefixed with FT) the User should refer to the Main Funds Transfer Application flow chart.
All of the files detailed within the chart have the standard 3 versions:            .'Live' file            .'Unauthorised' file            .'History' file.

AC         Account Transfer.  An Inhouse transfer of funds, i.e. where no external payment is involved in the execution of the Standing Order instruction.  This Pay Method code will be always applicable for the Balance Maintenance Standing Order types.

OC        Outward by cheque.  The issuing by the bank, of a local currency Manager cheque or Bank cheque to execute the Standing Order instruction.  The Customer for example, would have requested to Wonder Bank London, to pay every month by the debit of his current account GBP 100,00 to Mr R Perryman living in London.  The bank could then choose to pay the beneficiary by Manager cheque.

OD        Outward by Draft.  The issuing by the bank of a bank Draft (usually in foreign currency) to execute the Standing Order instruction.  The Customer would, for example,  have requested Wonder Bank London, to pay every month by the debit of his current account BEF 20,000 to Mr T Champagne living in Brussels.  The bank could then choose to pay by Bank Draft.

OT         Outward by Telex.  The issuing by the bank of a Telex payment to execute the Standing Order instruction.  The Customer would for example, have requested Wonder Bank London, to pay every month by the debit of his current account DEM 20,000.00 to Mr D Holland living in Frankfurt.  The bank could then choose to pay by Telex if the bank and the Account number of the beneficiary of the Standing Order has been indicated by the Customer.

OB         Outward by Bankers Payment.  The issuing by the bank of a Banker payment to execute the Standing Order instruction.  This method of payment is followed in the United Kingdom to perform local currency interbank payments.

BC         Outward by Local Clearing.  This Payment method can only be used if the clearing system is defined on FT.LOCAL.CLEARING.

1.         Field 11 is left blank
In this case, an amount corresponding to exactly the            overdraft will be transferred into the current account,            i.e.  150.00.  This will mean that the next debit on this            current account will overdraw it again and trigger a new            BI transaction.

/* Identifies the type of Standing Order.
The User will first need to define the various types of Standing Orders in the Standing Order Type table which will be used to provide the enrichment of the Standing Order type being defined. When creating the Standing Order Type table, care must be taken to define exactly the 8 different types in the same format as described above. These types have been hardcoded in the Standing Order program and any other code will be refused by the Application.
The following types will be accepted:
Balance Maintenance Standing Order Types
BI The Account is to be maintained at a minimum balance and will make Payments In when the balance of this account is below the specified balance. The abbreviation BI stands for Balance maintenance In and the sequential number will be between 900 and 999.
BO The account is to be maintained at a maximum balance and will make Payments Out when the balance of this account is in excess of the specified balance. The abbreviation BO stands for Balance maintenance Out the sequential number will be between 900 and 999.
BP The balance on a fixed length savings account is to be paid away on maturity date.
Regular Payments Standing Order Types
FI The Customer has given instruction to the bank to pay on a regular basis a Fixed amount and debit one of his accounts.
PP The Customer has authorised the bank to pay bills from third parties upon presentation of these bills. The amount will vary and there is no definitive frequency. Therefore, whenever an amount is input, the payment will be made that day and the payments program will delete the amount from the Standing Order record.
PPI The interest capitalising on a savings account is to be paid away on a periodic basis.
RC Set up to indicate a payment due on a revolving credit account. Payments are made on a regular basis and the amount due can be determined using a locally developed routine. The purpose of the RC standing order is to record the amount due using the Past Due module (PD). No actual accounting entries will be produced by RC type standing orders. The RC type standing order is only applicable to systems with the PD module installed and with revolving credit accounts set up. The key should be in the 900 to 999 range.
3. Diary Standing Order Type
DIARY Used to define any type of Diary instructions on a specific account. When this Standing Order type is used, input will then become mandatory in the Field Diary Details of the Standing Order record.
This type of Standing Order instruction will be created by the User for any type of Memo instructions which are to be recorded in the System and will then provide an on-line reminder of the action to be taken when the User displays the contents of the file STO.DIARY. Specific instructions received in advance are another example of details which could be loaded as a Diary Standing Order type.
Each time that the User is creating a DIARY Standing Order item, the System will automatically update an internal file STO.DIARY which will allow Users to review, whenever desired, their own list of Diary instructions or the complete list of Diary instructions outstanding in the Application. Any diary item will remain in that list until a positive action has been taken by the User to eliminate the entry from the file. This will be done by the Standard Reverse function (code R) which, for this particular file, will not need to go through the Authorisation process.
Direct Debit Standing Order Type
DD The bank has a direct debit mandate from the Customer which authorises the bank to accept direct debits received on the Account. This type of Standing Order will be completely passive in the sense that its sole purpose is to provide the User with an on-line retrieval facility of Direct Debit mandates held by the bank. When direct debits are received by the bank, the User can then verify on-line if proper authority has been received from the Customer.
Operating Lease Standing Order Type
OL type Standing Orders cater for Operating Leasing contracts and the accrual of the Standing Order amount.
Examples:
The following are typical examples of the above Standing Order types.
1. Type BI -The customer has requested the bank to cover automatically any overdraft in his current account by debiting, for example, his savings account. In this case, the specified balance will be 0 and when the balance will be below 0 an automatic transfer will then be generated from the savings account to feed the current account.
2. Type BO - The customer has requested the bank to transfer automatically from his current account any amount in excess of a specified balance by crediting for example, his savings account. In the case the specified balance would be GBP 1,000.00 and when the balance is in excess of this amount, an automatic transfer will then be generated by the Application by which the excess of GBP 1,000.00 will be transferred out of the current account to the savings account specified by the Customer.
3. Type FI -The customer has requested the bank to pay every month, for example, the rent for his house. In this example, the amount will be specified by the Customer and in that sense the amount of the Standing Order is Fixed. To project cash flows, forward entries raised for the Internal/Customer accounts given in the Standing Order with STO.TYPE as "FI".
Under this Type, it is possible to define Credit



4. Type PP - The customer has requested the bank to pay, whenever received, the bills received from the Telephone company or the Electricity board, the Gas board etc. In this case, the amount will not be specified by the Customer but only the name of the companies for which bills may be accepted and paid automatically on their receipt by the bank. For this type of Standing Order (which is also called domiciliation on the Continent), the Customer will also have informed the relevant companies to send their bills directly to his bank.
5. Type DD -The customer has authorised the bank to accept direct debits remitted by the Building Company to pay the monthly instalments of the Mortgage loan that the Customer has contracted with the Building company. The amount is not always specified for Direct Debits Standing Order and, if entered, will only be considered as an information field.
6. Type OL - The customer may lease an asset from the bank in which case the Standing Order id is a valid customer acount and accrual entries are a debit to the suspense account and a credit to th P+L category. On repayment the customer account (from the ID) is debited with the SO amount and the suspense account ( the counterparty account no) is credited with the SO amount . The bank may lease an asset from a customer in which case the id must be a valid suspense account and the counterpary account is a valid customer account. Accrual enteries are a debit to the P+L category with the accrual amount and a credit to the suspense account. On repayment there is a debit of the standing order amount to the suspense account and a credit to the customer account
7. Type RC - A customer has a revolving credit account with payments due on a monthly basis, the amount due can vary depending on the balance of the RC account. An RC standing order is set up on a monthly frequency making use of the CUR.AMT.ROUTINE field to call a locally developed routine to calculate the amount due. When the standing order is activated the amount will be determined and used to populate the CUR.AMOUNT.BAL field. A PD.PAYMENT.DUE record will be created with a contingent balance to indicate the amount due. When a credit entry is posted to the revolving credit account with the THEIR.REFERENCE field on the STMT.ENTRY set to the RC account number, the PD record will be credited with the amount on the entry , before the amount is credited to the RC account. When the PD has been cleared it will be written to history.
Validation Rules:

Up to 5 type SSS (uppercase alpha) characters as defined         in the Details. Any other value will be refused.         (Mandatory input.)
The Standing Order type must first have been defined on         the Standing Order type table and only the above values         will be accepted.
The same balance maintenance Standing Order type can only         be used once per account as defined below: 900 A number         in this range will 999 always be assigned to Balance         Maintenance Standing Order types BI BO and BP.
When a Standing Order number 900 to 999 has been input by         the User, the value of this field can only be BI or BO or         BP. */
