/* The Company file contains details of the Company's name, the Mnemonic (by which all the files maintain at this company's level are prefixed), the file classification details, the applications to be run and Company level defaults and parameters.
The Reverse (R) function is not allowed for a company record. The input, copy, delete, authorise, see and print functions are all available.
This application is invoked from one of two sources:
(a) Automatically from within the installation process for the loading     of a new processing company record.
(b) On-line to enable amendment or enquiry and the loading of a new     Consolidation Company record.
The procedures for setting up a new processing company are explained in the Installation guide.
For reporting purposes a Consolidation Company may be required.  A Consolidation Company could be used to cover something like a Continent/ Region, that is a non-existing Company.
Once a Company record has been loaded it is possible On-line to amend certain fields and also to view each field, whether input, internal or externally maintained, together with the associated field level help-text.
There are 3 types of non consolidation company record, all of which can produce a full set of financail reports.
The Master company is the very first company installed on the system (usually BNK).
A Lead company is a company that owns its own financial files, (the Master company is a Lead Company). A lead company is the equivalent of a company in a multi company set up.
A Branch company is linked to a Lead company  and uses the same data files as its Lead company with the exception of financial reporting files.
The type of company is determined when the company is created via the COMPANY.CREATE application.
Files containing financial records are kept separate for each Company, but can be combined, for reporting purposes.
The non-financial data files can be shared with other companies or can be separate depending upon the details loaded for the Company.
The standard name of this file is COMPANY. */

/* Introduced in G13.2.
Specifies the ID of the Company whose consolidation definition would be used  for this Company. Company specific consolidation definition is used to determine the   Company  specific (second) component  of consolidation files' record keys.
The variable parameters  in the  consolidation file (CONSOLIDATE.ASST.LIAB and CONSOLIDATE.PRFT.LOSS) record keys could have two components separated by '_',  the first one from default consolidation definition and second one  from Company specific consolidation definition. The default component is  determined by the CONSOLIDATE.COND records with the IDs ASSET&LIAB and PROFIT&LOSS. The Company specific component is determined by the CONSOLIDATE.COND records with the IDs ASSET&LIAB.xxxxxxxxx and PROFIT&LOSS.xxxxxxxxx, if they exist,  where xxxxxxxxx is the ID of the COMPANY.
If  two or more Companies share the same Company specific consolidation definitions, then it is not necessary to define separate Company specific CONSOLIDATE.COND records  for each Company. It is enough if the Company specific CONSOLIDATE.COND records  are defined   for one Company only  and other Companies are allowed  to share that definition. The ID of the Company whose  Company specific CONSOLIDATE.COND records need  to be shared, is  attached to this field in the COMPANY record of  the  sharing  Companies.
If no value is specified in this field, it is equivalent to attaching the same Company ID, in which case, the Company specific CONSOLIDATE.COND records of   the current Company would be used to determine the second component of consolidation key variables.
For example, the Companies CO2 (ID: US0010002) and CO3 (ID:US0010003) share the same Company specific consolidation definition. The records ASSET&LIAB.US0010002 and PROFIT&LOSS.US0010002 are defined in CONSOLIDATE.COND. In the Company record of US0010003, the field CONS.KEY.CO is updated with the value of US0010002. In this case, the Company CO3 would  use the CONSOLIDATE.COND records ASSET&LIAB.US0010002 and PROFIT&LOSS.US0010002 to determine the Company specific components of consolidation key variables.

Note : The files in the system are grouped as follows:
Installation This covers files like Company, User, Language where more than one copy/ version of the file cannot be processed within one installation.
Customer This group is for files where the key is the customer number or customer number assumed, like the CUSTOMER.DEFAULT file, the LIMIT file.
Customer Tables This group is for the files that are used as checkfiles for customer level files.
Financial This group covers the files whose financial fields feed the financial base from which the chart of accounts is drawn. Also included are other files with the same key as the financial file(s).  For example, financial files are ACCOUNT, FUNDS.TRANSFER, and LETTER.OF.CREDIT.  Similar key files are ACCOUNT.STATEMENT, ACCOUNT.CREDIT.INT etc.
Financial Tables This group is for the files that are used as checkfiles for financial level files. The files in this group contain non financial data.
Financial Tables - Financial Files in this group are linked to financial level files and also contain financial level data. Example of files in this group are GROUP.DEBIT.INT, TAX, TRANSACTION
Currency This group is for the currency and associated files.
Nostro This group is for files that are held for Nostro accounts.
The installation level files will only be maintained at F. level. Therefore, no file mnemonics will be held on the COMPANY record for the installation level.
All other level files will not start with F. but will start with F followed by a company mnemonic then a full stop.
The company code and mnemonic for each level except the financial level are held on this file (COMPANY).
For the table levels there is a default company.  For Customer tables and for Financial tables there is the opportunity for file(s) to be linked to a different Company from the default.  When a special company is entered it is to be checked that its for the same or higher level.  This latter facility is not available for Financial tables with Financial data on them.
The groups have been classified as follows on the FILE.CONTROL file as follows:                   INT - Installation                   CUS - Customer                   CST - Customer table                   FIN - Financial                   FTD - Financial Table Descriptive                   FTF - Financial Table Financial                   CCY - Currency                   NOS - Nostro

Company Group Codes are used to identify the various operating companies, using the T24 system.  The Company Group code is part of the 'T24 Company' key and as such will help in identifying for a particular operating company the 'T24 Companies' that have been set up for it. This will help in reports etc. being grouped/combined.
Thus for each of the T24 Company records for the same operating company the Company Group must be the same.  Therefore the same Company Group codes will need to be created at each of the locations where the organisation is operating the T24 system.
The format of the Company Code is:
CC GGG LLLL
Where:
CC   is  Country Code
GGG  is  Company Group Code
LLLL is  Local Code
Note : Local code must be different for each location/ branch within one        country even if the processing is run in different environments.
The Company Group Code thus forms the centre portion of the individual Company records. */
