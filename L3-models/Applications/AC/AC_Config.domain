/* This document describes the use and purpose of the ACCOUNT.CLASS table.
The standard T24 function codes (I for Input, A for Authorisation, D for Delete, etc...) are used within the ACCOUNT.CLASS Application.  However, the Reverse function (function code R) is not permitted.
This table file has two types of entries.  This first type (Account) provides the Category Code portion when building an Internal Account Number (such as Computer Suspense Account).  The second type (Class) provides the parameters required to identify a group of accounts (e.g. under a heading like NOSTRO) by matching the account details against those held in the account class record.
When the record type is ACCOUNT then the category code must be valid and in the range 10000 to 19999.
When the record type is CLASS the category and sector code fields are treated as multi value associated fields.  Either field may be null but not both at the same time.  Duplications of category and sector code combined are not allowed within one entry on the ACCOUNT.CLASS table.
List of key values used
The following are the allowed key values by Type:

Key Value       Description
SUSPENSE        To be used when the DATA.CAPTURE system                 generates suspense entries at the end of day for                 those entries which have not been authorised.
DIFFERENCE      To be used when the DATA.CAPTURE system has                 to raise an entry to balance a batch as part of the                 end of day processing.
SUSPCREDIT/     To be used when the end of day accounting module SUSPDEBIT       raises a credit/debit suspense entry as original                 entry can not be posted due to account not                 being present or override condition has been met.

/* The ACCOUNT PARAMETER record contains information relating to: -   Cashflow -   Value Date Accounting -   Alternate Account Identifier -   Customer Number within Account Number
CASHFLOW For the cashflow the number of days for the cashflow window is stored in the field CASH.FLOW.DAYS.

VALUE DATE ACCOUNTING For the account transaction modules, e.g. Data Capture, Funds Transfer and Teller, the account entries can either be passed on Entry Date or on Value date.  For 'Deal' modules entries are either passed on value or there is an option to have either trade date or settlement date accounting.  The processing controlled from here is that for the account transaction modules.
The default option is entry date accounting.
Once value date accounting has been turned on it can not be turned off.
When value date accounting is turned on.  For any account transaction module transaction with forward value date(s).  The contingent section of the CRB base is updated with the forward amounts.  The currency Position file is updated for the value date, when foreign currency is involved.  On the value date the real entries are passed.
If there is a split value date in the transaction then entries to local suspense account are used to maintain balanced entries each day.  Thus the second dates movements are in the suspense account between first and second value dates.
The forward currency position can be revalued according to the details set up on the FX.PARAMETERS record.  See fields REVALUE.FWD.AL and FWD.AL.REVAL.CATEG.  Also the ACCOUNT.CLASS record EXCHALFWD needs to be set up.
On this file the fields VALUE.DATED.ACCTING to SUSPENSE.HISTORY are used for value dated accounting processing.

ALTERNATE ACCOUNT IDENTIFIERS When accounts have been taken over from another system it is useful to be able to enter the old systems account identifier.  This can be done by creating the file ALTERNATE.ACCOUNT during the takeover processing and then switch on the checking routine uses the field ALTERNATE.ACC.IDS on the ACCOUNT.PARAMETER file.

CUSTOMER NUMBER WITH ACCOUNT NUMBER When the Customer Number is to be part of the Account Number, then the position of this within the Account Number is specified here.  When a new customer account is opened the system will check that the Customer Number in the key matches that in the record.
Note: It must be noted that any change to the values in the fields will       only take effect after the user has signed off and then on again to       T24. */

CHEQUE TYPE DEFAULT IN DC/FT/TT
If the Cheque.Register is set as Yes,
If the transaction code used in DC/FT/TT, has cheque indicator as Yes in TRANSACTION file, then cheque.type will be defaulted as per the following:
1.If the Debit account has a record in CHEQUE.TYPE.ACCOUNT, that cheque.type will be defaulted.
2. If debit account has more than one record in CHEQUE.TYPE.ACCOUNT, then based on the range of cheque number issued for that account, appropriate cheque.type will be defaulted
3. If debit account has more than one record in CHEQUE.TYPE.ACCOUNT and both cheque type has same range of cheque number issued, then User has to enter the cheque.type
4. However user will not be able to enter a cheque.type, which is not available for the account in CHEQUE.TYPE.ACCOUNT.
5. If it does not satisfies above condition, then it will default to NULL. If Cheque.Register set as NO or NULL, then cheque.type will default to NULL.
PAYMENT STOP PROCESSING.
If the Cheque.Register is set as Yes,
1. Cheque type will be defaulted in payment stop as per the above cheque type defaulting mechanism.
2. Payment stop override gets generated in DC/FT/DC processing only when the cheque.type and cheque.no entered in DC/FT/TT matches with the cheque.type and cheque.no in PAYMENT. STOP
If the Cheque.Register is set as No,
1. Cheque type will not be defaulted in the payment stop and can be null.
2. Payment stop override will be raised if the cheque.no entered in the DC/FT/TT application matches with the PAYMENT.STOP cheque number irrespective of the Cheque.type
For more information see the payment stop processing.

"CATG" for a CATEG.ENTRY
"SPEC" for an RE.CONSOL.SPEC.ENTRY
"CONSOL" for a CONSOL.ENT.TODAY entry

2 the accounting type that is passed
Values can be as follows for authorised non forward entries
"AUT" , "VALAUT", "ADD.AUT", "SAO"
"AUT" indicates that entries are being authorised
"VALAUT" and "ADD.AUT" indicate that entries are being validated and authorised
"SAO" indicates that entries are being authorised with automatic acceptance of overrides which will be stored in the override field of the passed entry

Values can be as follows for authorised forward entries
"AUT", "SNP.AUT" REV.AUT
NB when a forward contract is reversed before the value date the FWD.STMT entries will be reversed, with no "real" accounting having taken place, the TYPE used here is REV.AUT. Often the forward entries will be replaced by "real" entries as the contract becomes active, for example when the processing date is reached on a forward valued FT contract.
3 the record @id of the entry
4 the actual entry

NB: Reversal entries can be identified by "REV" in the RECORD.STATUS field

This will be washed out when the second leg reaches its value date.  The suspense account that is used is determined by the category of the second leg entry. This field and its associated field SUS.CATEGORY define this relationship,  e.g.
3.1        ENTRY.CATEGORY
4.1        SUS.CATEGORY       19998
3.2        ENTRY.CATEGORY      5000-XX
4.2        SUS.CATEGORY       19999
3.3        ENTRY.CATEGORY 51000
4.2        SUS.CATEGORY 12999
ENTRY.CATEGORY is a start of range value. Hence in this example 'second leg' entries with a category in the range 0 - 4999 will be suspensed using account LCL199980001 (where LCL = local currency code). Entries with a category 5000 and above will be suspensed using LCL199990001. To define one suspense account for all categories simple define:
3.1        ENTRY.CATEGORY
4.1        SUS.CATEGORY       19998
The purpose of these fields is to allow you to split suspense movements, for value dated accounting, within the CRB. For example you may want to report entries suspensed for Nostros separately from entries suspensed for current accounts.

/* Specifies whether standard defaulting is to be applied for the associated SYS.CODE.
No value in this field denotes that the standard defaulting rules for the application will be applied for an account of the specified SYS.CODE.
If this field contains the value NONE then NO standard defaulting will be performed for accounts of that type. The underlying application may apply it's own specific defaulting rules if this is defined as NONE.
Example:
1. The MM application is required to default the Drawdown account in the    standard manner (portfolio, VOSTRO account, Customer account, Nostro    account), PRIN.LIQ.ACCT and INT.LIQ.ACCT should use the Drawdown    account as the default. An override is required if a different account    is entered from the default, and if more than one possible default is    found the first account should be used.
The definition in ACCOUNT.PARAMETER should be:
SYS.CODE       MM-DD  MM-PRIN MM-INT    DEF.OVERRIDE     Y      Y       Y    USE.FIRST.ACCT   Y      Y       Y    DEFAULT.ORDER          NONE    NONE
When the money market deal is entered, if a Drawdown account has been    entered or defaulted, and no input (or return) is entered in the    PRIN.LIQ or INT.LIQ accounts, the drawdown account will be defaulted.    Note that this processing is specific to the Money Market application    and may not necessarily operate in the same manner for other    applications.
2. As per the above example except that the PRIN.LIQ.ACCT and INT.LIQ.ACCT    should always default according to the standard rules.
The definition in ACCOUNT.PARAMETER should be
SYS.CODE       MM    DEF.OVERRIDE   Y    USE.FIRST.ACCT Y    DEFAULT.ORDER
Note this could also be defined as
SYS.CODE       MM-DD  MM-PRIN MM-INT    DEF.OVERRIDE     Y      Y       Y    USE.FIRST.ACCT   Y      Y       Y    DEFAULT.ORDER
On input of DRAWDOWN, PRIN.LIQ and INT.LIQ accounts, the system will    attempt to default according to the standard rules.
In case the underlying Contract Customer (eg. Customer.id in MONEYMARKET, Counterparty in FOREX) has a matching record in CUSTOMER.SSI application, then the account numbers for the relevant settlement fields get defaulted as per the definition for that Customer in CUSTOMER.SSI.
For example
Let the definition in ACCOUNT.PARAMETER be
SYS.CODE MM DEF.OVERRIDE Y USE.FIRST.ACCT Y DEFAULT.ORDER
Try creating a MM contract in a currency for a customer who has a record in CUSTOMER.SSI with the same combination. The relevant settlement fields such as Drawdown account , Principal liquidation account and Interest liquidation account get defaulted with the accounts defined in the matching record in CUSTOMER.SSI.
The rules for defaulting will vary according to the application, the    user guide should be consulted for details.
